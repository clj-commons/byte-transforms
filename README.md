This library helps you **hash**, **compress**, and **encode** streams of bytes.  It contains the methods in the standard Java lib, as well as a curated collection of the best available methods.

## Usage

#### Leiningen
```clojure
[org.clj-commons/byte-transforms "0.2.1"]
```
#### deps.edn
```clojure
org.clj-commons/byte-transforms {:mvn/version "0.2.1"}
```

All functions are in the `byte-transforms` namespace.  There are five primary functions, `hash`, `compress`, `decompress`, `encode`, and `decode`.  Each takes three arguments: the bytes, the method, and an (optional) options map.  The bytes can be anything which is part of the [byte-stream](https://github.com/ztellman/byte-streams) conversion graph.

```clojure
byte-transforms> (hash "hello" :murmur64)
2191231550387646743

byte-transforms> (compress "hello" :snappy)
#<byte[] [B@7e0f980b>
byte-transforms> (byte-streams/to-string (decompress *1 :snappy))
"hello"

byte-transforms> (byte-streams/to-string (encode "hello" :base64 {:url-safe? false}))
"aGVsbG8"
byte-transforms> (byte-streams/to-string (decode *1 :base64))
"hello"
```

Note that Base64 encoding defaults to the [URL-safe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#URL_applications) variant, which means that the output will not be padded.  This can be disabled by passing in `{:url-safe? false}` to `encode`.

Available methods can be found via `available-hash-functions`, `available-compressors`, and `available-encoders`:

```clojure
byte-transforms> (available-hash-functions)
(:sha384 :md2 :crc32 :crc64 :sha512 :sha1 :murmur32 :murmur128 :adler32 :sha256 :md5 :murmur64)

byte-transforms> (available-compressors)
(:lz4 :bzip2 :snappy :gzip)

byte-transforms> (available-encoders)
(:base64)
```

When choosing a compression algorithm, `snappy` is typically the fastest, `bzip2` yields the highest compression, and `lz4` provides a good balance between higher compression rate and fast decompression.  All the compression algorithms except `lz4` are concat-able; multiple compressed segments can be concatenated and decompressed as a single stream.

Full stats on all methods can be found by cloning the project and running `lein test :benchmark`.
